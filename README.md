Web-based applications offer several advantages over traditional software applications, such as automatic updates, easy accessibility, and more. Therefore, the technical staffs of Asian College of Technology need a faster and more reliable way in doing their inventory and reporting to make their work easier and faster, thus improving their work efficiency and productivity. 
The type of system the researchers will incorporate is a desktop Computer Laboratory Inventory System. It will track all computer equipment, software, and hardware in one place. The system will help technical staffs monitor the status and condition of laboratory equipment. It will provide real-time information about the equipment‚Äôs location, maintenance needs and history, equipment status, adding of new equipment in the laboratory, notifies upcoming warranty expiration, and automated generation of inventory reports. The system aims to streamline laboratory management and improve resource utilization. Manual inventory systems are inefficient and prone to human error. It causes problems such as tracking of equipment becomes difficult with traditional record-keeping methods, staff spend excessive time managing physical inventories and updating records manually. The research objective is to create a smart and efficient way of managing computer laboratory resources. The system will help track equipment, predict maintenance needs, and make it easier for staff to do their inventory. 
The researchers‚Äô motivation is to improve the efficiency of laboratory management. The system will reduce time wasted on manual tracking and minimize human error. It represents a step towards more modern and effective computer laboratory inventory management system.

‚öîÔ∏è Implementation Strategies

‚û§ The implementation strategies toward modernizing the computer laboratory inventory management system and tracking resources at the College of Computer Studies, Asian College of Technology, follow a structured and organized approach to ensure a smooth transition from development to operational use. The process starts from a detailed project timeline. It outlines each phase during development plus testing and deployment so this ensures all milestones can be met on schedule. Resource allocation plays a major role in this phase because of how dedicated teams are assigned to various tasks such as software development or testing or user training plus technical support. This allocation ensures personnel are adequately allocated as well as tools are available for every project's critical step. During the deployment phase, proactive actions address the risk management topic. As contingency plans to reduce these risks are developed, early identification of possible dangers like software bugs, system downtime, or user resistance occurs. This includes that people create backups, establish troubleshooting protocols, and maintain open communication with all. Stakeholders should make sure to resolve issues promptly as they do arise. Additionally, we need to assure quality since it is very important. We must implement this as a core planned aspect now. Multiple rounds of testing are performed on the system, including unit tests, along with full-scale system tests. All functionalities perform as expected because of this action. The system meets user expectations, iterative improvements are allowed, since there are continuous feedback loops with selected testers. The system rollout is done in a gradual way, with user training sessions scheduled so that they introduce the laboratory staff to the new desktop application, finally. Comprehensive user guides and documentation are provided to assist in the learning process. This structured approach ensures a smooth deployment of the system, transforming laboratory management processes into more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly operations.
